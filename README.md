yp-api
======
A code library to work with YP.com's public API available at: http://developer.yp.com/


Currently contains only a Python library. YP's Deals endpoint does not seem to be in use any more but Coupons seems to provide the current "Deals" information as displayed on the site.

Just type commands based on the options in the file, for example: 

`python search.py --term='elephant statues' --searchloc='san francisco ca'`

This will return a list of `elephant statues` in `san francisco ca`

Email me with questions, or feel free to fork to improve/contribute in more languages.
